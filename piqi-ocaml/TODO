This is a list of ideas of how to improve piqi-ocaml.

Current issues and feature requests: https://github.com/alavrik/piqi-ocaml/issues


New features
------------

- optionally, treat Piqi enums as OCaml integers and generate enum constants as
  constants instead of polymorphic variants


Optimizations
-------------

- profile and optimize piqirun.ml, e.g. varint encoding, record parsing, GC
  behavior, etc.


Miscellaneous
-------------

- add piqi-any example that demonstrates use of embedded JSON/XML (now that we
  have piqi_piqi.ml as a part of piqilib); see piqi-erlang/examples/piqi-any for
  details

- more tests
