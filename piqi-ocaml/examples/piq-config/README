This is an example of how to use configuration file in Piq format from OCaml
program.

To build the example, run "make".

The resulting "./config" executable will read the config data structure from
"config.piq" and print it on stdout.


Files:
        config.piqi - the definition of the config file format
        config.piq  - an example config file
        config.ml   - an OCaml program that reads the "config.piq" file
